SOPs typically should be a live documentation hub, the idea is that you iteratively build on top of previous versions. Because this iterative advance of textual-formatted information is naturally handled by version control systems, we propose Git/GitHub as a convenient way of maintaining and working on this document. This also permits many typical operations that implicitly happen with SOPs documents:</p> <ul> <li>forking: someone in an institution created an original SOPs document, which over time got copied over and child documents continued their lives;</li> <li>branching: one of those SOPs documents was evolved for a particular study that was almost like the original project, except for minimal differences;</li> <li>merging: a branch became important enough to become a constituent part of the original SOPs from which it derived; and</li> <li>versioning: it is critical to keep track of all changes in the SOPs, and even more important to take snapshots of the document at relevant milestones of its life cycle (e.g., version - [ ]0).</li> </ul> <p>All of these operations are naturally part of Git.</p>"},{"location":"#publishing-sops","title":"Publishing SOPs","text":"<p>Although very hardly other researchers will have access to the exact same settings detailed in your SOPs, they document all the incremental decisions that together implement your methods.

The second and third components (XX and YY) are suggested as follows: - Modify the minor component (XX) whenever there are large changes in your documents that make your SOPs substantially different from a previous version. - Modify the patch component (YY) whenever there are small changes like typos, reordering, planned iterations, etc. that you want to record as relevant steps, but basically do not change the SOPs in a substantial manner. One final recommendation is to only set the minor (XX) above zero when your SOPs are ready for production. In other words, keep XX with zero (e.g., 2022.0.YY) during the process of developing your SOPs before the study starts. Then change XX to one before you run the first data collection session following the SOPs (e.g., create the version 2022.1.1 right before the first time you will use your SOPs)</p>"},{"location":"changes/","title":"Change History","text":"<p>All notable changes to these SOPs are documented below, starting with the most recent version of the document.</p> <p>You found an error</p> <p>If you want to check the list of open issues, please proceed to our issue tracker.</p> <p>If you have identified a problem, a typo, or something missing, and you know it is not in our tracker, please report it by creating a new issue.</p>"},{"location":"changes/#2300-august-18-2023","title":"23.0.0 (August 18, 2023)","text":"<p>Compare with first commit</p>"},{"location":"changes/#enhancements-new-features-and-additions","title":"Enhancements, new features, and additions","text":"<ul> <li>Finalize configuration of changes tracking with git-changelog  (185b059 by Oscar Esteban).</li> <li>Add changelog update routine  (753f84f by Oscar Esteban).</li> <li>Clarify secrets file utilization  (ad01409 by Oscar Esteban).</li> <li>Outsource secrets file and document how to use the secrets  (150326e by Oscar Esteban).
